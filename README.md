# ESE421PiControl
In this project we construct an autonomous vehicle using an Arduino Mega and Raspberry Pi. To run place the file in the Arduino Clean folder onto the Arduino and run the file Bus.py from the command line on the Pi using sudo python Bus.py. Note that the Pi codes run using Python 2.7 and makes use of OpenCV 2.4 (which is not backwards compatible with later versions of OpenCV).
